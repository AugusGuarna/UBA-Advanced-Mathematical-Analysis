# Advanced Mathematical Analysis: Theory & Solutions

This repository contains a comprehensive set of solutions and proofs for Advanced Mathematical Analysis (Real Analysis). 

## 📌 Overview
This archive serves as a technical resource for the study of multivariable analysis and topological foundations. It includes detailed solutions to problem sets and past examinations, with an emphasis on clarity and logical flow.

## 📂 Content Breakdown

### 📘 Problem Guides (6 - 9)
These guides focus on the transition from single-variable theory to higher-dimensional spaces:
* **Guide 6: Metric Spaces & Topology** – Convergence, completeness, and compactness in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
* **Guide 7: Multivariable Differentiation** – Total derivatives, Jacobian matrices, and the Inverse/Implicit Function Theorems.
* **Guide 8: Integration Theory** – Riemann integration in multiple variables and Fubini’s Theorem.
* **Guide 9: Vector Analysis & Manifolds** – Line and surface integrals, culminating in the Generalized Stokes' Theorem.

### 📝 Examination Archive
* Detailed solutions to second exams.
